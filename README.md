# Learning-Projects

Theese are various projects from learning sites such as freeCodeCamp, Odin Project, Coursera...

I just gathered them in a single repo to organize and keep.

Just a static website for a made up company. Main goals were to learn;

- A pretty basic layout.

This one was from Coursera.
