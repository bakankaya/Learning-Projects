# Learning-Projects

Theese are various projects from learning sites such as freeCodeCamp, Odin Project, Coursera...

I just gathered them in a single repo to organize and keep.

This one is from Coursera. Just a static website for a made up company. Main goals were to learn;

Visual layout, Semantic structure, CSS layout, CSS styling, CSS effects

A pretty basic layout.
